. O
you O
can O

we O
suggest O
you O
first O
think O
carefully O
about O
whether O
this O

the O
ordinary O
general O

is O
the O
better O
strategy O
to O
use O
in O
any O
particular O
case O
, O
based O
on O
the O
explanations O
below O
. O
when O
we O
speak O
of O
free O
software O
, O
we O
are O
referring O
to O
freedom O
of O

, O
not O

. O
our O
general O
public O

are O
designed O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
you O
have O
the O
freedom O
to O
distribute O
copies O
of O
free O
software O
( O
and O
charge O
for O
this O

if O
you O

; O
that O
you O
receive O

code O
or O
can O
get O
it O
if O
you O
want O
it O
; O
that O
you O
can O
change O
the O

and O
use O
pieces O
of O
it O
in O
new O
free O

; O
and O
that O
you O
are O
informed O
that O
you O
can O
do O
these O
things O
. O
to O
protect O
your O
rights O
, O
we O
need O
to O
make O
restrictions O
that O
forbid O
distributors O
to O
deny O
you O
these O
rights O
or O
to O
ask O
you O
to O
surrender O
these O

. O
these O
restrictions O
translate O
to O
certain O
responsibilities O
for O
you O
if O
you O
distribute O
copies O
of O
the O
library O
or O
if O
you O
modify O
it O
. O
for O
example O
, O
if O
you O
distribute O
copies O
of O
the O
library O
, O
whether O
gratis O
or O
for O
a O
fee O
, O
you O
must O
give O
the O

all O
the O

that O
we O
gave O
you O

you O
must O
make O
sure O
that O

get O
the O

. O
if O
you O
link O
other O
code O
with O
the O
library O
, O
you O
must O
provide O
complete O
object O
files O
to O
the O
recipients O
, O
so O
that O
they O
can O
relink O
them O
with O
the O
library O
after O
making O
changes O
to O
the O
library O
and O
recompiling O
it O
. O
and O
you O
must O
show O
them O
these O
terms O
so O
they O
know O
their O
rights O
. O
we O
protect O
your O
rights O
with O
a O
two-step O
method O
: O
( O
) O
we O
copyright O
the O
library O
, O
and O
( O
) O
we O
offer O
you O
this O
license O
, O
which O
gives O
you O
legal O
permission O
to O
copy O
, O
distribute B-0
and/or O
modify B-1
the O
library O
. O
to O
protect O
each O
distributor O
, O
we O
want O
to O
make O
it O
very O
clear O
that O
there O
is O
no O
warranty O
for O
the O
free O
library O
. O
also O
, O
if O
the O
library O
is O
modified O
by O
someone O
else O
and O
passed O
on O
, O
the O
recipients O
should O
know O
that O
what O
they O
have O
is O
not O
the O
original O
version O
, O
so O
that O
the O
original O
author's O
reputation O
will O
not O
be O
affected O
by O
problems O
that O
might O
be O
introduced O
by O
others O
. O
finally O
, O
software O
patents O
pose O
a O
constant O
threat O
to O
the O
existence O
of O
any O
free O
program O
. O
we O
wish O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
a O
company O
cannot O
effectively O
restrict O
the O
users O
of O
a O
free O
program O
by O
obtaining O
a O
restrictive O
license O
from O
a O
patent O
holder O
. O
therefore O
, O
we O
insist O
that O
any O
patent O
license O
obtained O
for O
a O
version O
of O
the O
library O
must O
be O
consistent O
with O
the O
full O
freedom O
of O
use O
specified O
in O
this O
license O
. O
most O
gnu O
software O
, O
including O
some O
libraries O
, O
is O
covered O
by O
the O
ordinary O
gnu O
general O
public O
license O
. O
this O
license O
, O
the O
gnu O
lesser O
general O
public O
license O
, O
applies O
to O
certain O
designated O
libraries O
, O
and O
is O
quite O
different O
from O
the O
ordinary O
general O
public O
license O
. O
we O
use O
this O
license O
for O
certain O
libraries O
in O
order O
to O
permit O
linking O
those O
libraries O
into O
non-free O
programs O
. O
when O
a O
program O
is O
linked O
with O
a O
library O
, O
whether O
statically O
or O
using O
a O
shared O
library O
, O
the O
combination O
of O
the O
two O
is O
legally O
speaking O
a O
combined O
work O
, O
a O
derivative O
of O
the O
original O
library O
. O
the O
ordinary O
general O
public O
license O
therefore O
permits O
such O
linking O
only O
if O
the O
entire O
combination O
fits O
its O
criteria O
of O
freedom O
. O
the O
lesser O
general O
public O
license O
permits O
more O
lax O
criteria O
for O
linking O
other O
code O
with O
the O
library O
. O
we O
call O
this O
license O
the O
"lesser" O
general O
public O
license O
because O
it O
does O
less O
to O
protect O
the O
user's O
freedom O
than O
the O
ordinary O
general O
public O
license O
. O
it O
also O
provides O
other O
free O
software O
developers O
less O
of O
an O
advantage O
over O
competing O
non-free O
programs O
. O
these O
disadvantages O
are O
the O
reason O
we O
use O
the O
ordinary O
general O
public O
license O
for O
many O
libraries O
. O
however O
, O
the O
lesser O
license O
provides O
advantages O
in O
certain O
special O
circumstances O
. O
for O
example O
, O
on O
rare O
occasions O
, O
there O
may O
be O
a O
special O
need O
to O
encourage O
the O
widest O
possible O
use O
of O
a O
certain O
library O
, O
so O
that O
it O
becomes O
a O
de-facto O
standard O
. O
to O
achieve O
this O
, O
non-free O
programs O
must O
be O
allowed O
to O
use O
the O
library O
. O
a O
more O
frequent O
case O
is O
that O
a O
free O
library O
does O
the O
same O
job O
as O
widely O
used O
non-free O
libraries O
. O
in O
this O
case O
, O
there O
is O
little O
to O
gain O
by O
limiting O
the O
free O
library O
to O
free O
software O
only O
, O
so O
we O
use O
the O
lesser O
general O
public O
license O
. O
in O
other O
cases O
, O
permission O
to O
use O
a O
particular O
library O
in O
non-free O
programs O
enables O
a O
greater O
number O
of O
people O
to O
use O
a O
large O
body O
of O
free O
software O
. O
for O
example O
, O
permission O
to O
use O
the O
gnu O
c O
library O
in O
non-free O
programs O
enables O
many O
more O
people O
to O
use O
the O
whole O
gnu O
operating O
system O
, O
as O
well O
as O
its O
variant O
, O
the O
gnu/linux O
operating O
system O
. O
although O
the O
lesser O
general O
public O
license O
is O
less O
protective O
of O
the O
users' O
freedom O
, O
it O
does O
ensure O
that O
the O
user O
of O
a O
program O
that O
is O
linked O
with O
the O
library O
has O
the O
freedom O
and O
the O
wherewithal O

run O
that O

between O
