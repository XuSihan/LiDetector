asking O

therefore O

certain O
responsibilities O
if O
you O
distribute O
copies O

if O

: O
responsibilities O
to O

you O

developers O
that O
use O
the O
gnu O
gpl O
protect O
your O
rights O
with O
two O
steps O
: O
( O
) O
assert O
copyright O
on O
the O
software O
, O
and O
( O
) O
offer O
you O
this O
license O
giving O
you O
legal O
permission O
to O
copy B-8
, O
distribute B-0
and/or O
modify B-1
it I-1
. O
for O
the O
developers' O
and O
authors' O
protection O
, O
the O
gpl O
clearly O
explains O
that O
there O
is O
no O
warranty O
for O
this O
free O
software O
. O
for O
both O
users' O
and O
authors' O
sake O
, O
the O
gpl O
requires O
that O
modified O
versions O
be O
marked O
as O
changed O
, O
so O
that O
their O
problems O
will O
not O
be O
attributed O
erroneously O
to O
authors O
of O
previous O
versions O
. O
some O
devices O
are O
designed O
to O
deny O
users O
access O
to O
install O
or O
run O
modified O
versions O
of O
the O
software O
inside O
them O
, O
although O
the O
manufacturer O
can O
do O
so O
. O
this O
is O
fundamentally O
incompatible O
with O
the O
aim O
of O
protecting O
users' O
freedom O
to O
change O
the O
software O
. O
the O
systematic O
pattern O
of O
such O
abuse O
occurs O
in O
the O
area O
of O
products O
for O
individuals O
to O
use O
, O
which O
is O
precisely O
where O
it O
is O
most O
unacceptable O
. O
therefore O
, O
we O
have O
designed O
this O
version O
of O
the O
gpl O
to O
prohibit O
the O
practice O
for O
those O
products O
. O
if O
such O
problems O
arise O
substantially O
in O
other O
domains O
, O
we O
stand O
ready O
to O
extend O
this O
provision O
to O
those O
domains O
in O
future O
versions O
of O
the O
gpl O
, O
as O
needed O
to O
protect O
the O
freedom O
of O
users O
. O
finally O
, O
every O
program O
is O
threatened O
constantly O
by O
software O
patents O
. O
states O
should O
not O
allow O
patents O
to O
restrict O
development O
and O
use O
of O
software O
on O
general-purpose O
computers O
, O
but O
in O
those O
that O
do O
, O
we O
wish O
to O
avoid O
the O
special O
danger O
that O
patents O
applied O
to O
a O
free O
program O
could O
make O
it O
effectively O
proprietary O
. O
to O
prevent O
this O
, O
the O
gpl O
assures O
that O

cannot O
be O
