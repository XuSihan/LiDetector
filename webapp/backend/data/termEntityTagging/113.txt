a O

----------------------------------------------------- O
it O
is O
wise O
never O
to O
modify B-1
a O
component O
of O
the O

, O
even O
for O
your O
own O
personal O
use B-8
, O
without O
also O
meeting O
the B-4
above I-4
conditions O
for O
distributing O
the O
modified O
component O
. O
while O
you O
might O
intend O
that O
such O
modifications O
will O
never O
be O
distributed O
, O
often O
this O
will O
happen O
by O
accident O
-- O
you O
may O
forget O
that O
you O
have O
modified O
that O
component O
; O
or O
it O
may O
not O
occur O
to O
you O
when O
allowing O
others O
to O
access O
the O
modified O
version O
that O
you O
are O
thus O
distributing O
it O
and O
violating O
the O
conditions O
of O
this O

in O
ways O
that O
could O
have O
legal O
implications O
and O
, O
worse O
, O
cause O
problems O
for O
the O
community O
. O
it O
is O
therefore O
usually O
in O
your O
best O
interest O
to O
keep O
your O
copy O
of O
the O

identical O
with O
