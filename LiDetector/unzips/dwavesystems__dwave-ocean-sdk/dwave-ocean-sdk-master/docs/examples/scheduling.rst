Constrained Scheduling
======================

This example solves a binary *constraint satisfaction problem* (:term:`CSP`). CSPs require that all
a problem's variables be assigned values that result in the satisfying of all constraints.
Here, the constraints are a company's policy for scheduling meetings:

* Constraint 1: During business hours, all meetings must be attended in person at the office.
* Constraint 2: During business hours, participation in meetings is mandatory.
* Constraint 3: Outside business hours, meetings must be teleconferenced.
* Constraint 4: Outside business hours, meetings must not exceed 30 minutes.

Solving such a CSP means finding meetings that meet all the constraints.

The purpose of this example is to help a new user to formulate a constraint satisfaction problem
using Ocean tools and solve it on a D-Wave system.
Other examples demonstrate more advanced steps that might be needed for
complex problems.

Example Requirements
====================

To run the code in this example, the following is required.

* The requisite information for problem submission through SAPI, as described in :ref:`sapi_access`.
* Ocean tools :doc:`dwave-binarycsp </docs_binarycsp/sdk_index>`,
  :doc:`dwave-system </docs_system/sdk_index>`,
  and :doc:`dimod </docs_dimod/sdk_index>`.

Solution Steps
==============

Section :ref:`solving_problems` describes the process of solving problems on the quantum
computer in two steps: (1) Formulate the problem as a :term:`binary quadratic model` (BQM)
and (2) Solve the BQM with a D-Wave system or classical :term:`sampler`. In this example,
Ocean's *dwavebinarycsp* tool builds the BQM based on the constraints you formulate.

Formulate the Problem
=====================

D-Wave systems solve binary quadratic models, so the first step is to express the problem
with binary variables.

* Time of day is represented by binary variable :code:`time` with value :math:`1` for business hours
  and :math:`0` for hours outside the business day.
* Venue is represented by binary variable :code:`location` with value :math:`1` for office
  and :math:`0` for teleconference.
* Meeting duration is represented by variable :code:`length` with value :math:`1` for short meetings
  (under 30 minutes) and :math:`0` for meetings of longer duration.
* Participation is represented by variable :code:`mandatory` with value :math:`1` for mandatory
  participation and :math:`0` for optional participation.

For large numbers of variables and constraints, such problems can be hard.
This example has four binary variables, so only :math:`2^4=16` possible meeting arrangements.
As shown in the table below, it is a simple matter to work out all the combinations by hand to
find solutions that meet all the constraints.

Ocean's :doc:`dwavebinarycsp </docs_binarycsp/sdk_index>` enables the
definition of constraints in different ways, including by defining functions that evaluate
True when the constraint is met. The code below defines a function that returns True when
all this example's constraints are met.

.. testcode::

   def scheduling(time, location, length, mandatory):
       if time:                                 # Business hours
           return (location and mandatory)      # In office and mandatory participation
       else:                                    # Outside business hours
           return ((not location) and length)   # Teleconference for a short duration

The next code lines create a constraint from this function and adds it to CSP instance,
:code:`csp`, instantiated with binary variables.

>>> import dwavebinarycsp
>>> csp = dwavebinarycsp.ConstraintSatisfactionProblem(dwavebinarycsp.BINARY)
>>> csp.add_constraint(scheduling, ['time', 'location', 'length', 'mandatory'])

This tool, :doc:`dwavebinarycsp </docs_binarycsp/sdk_index>`, can also convert the binary CSP to a BQM. 
The following code does so and the graph below
provides a view on the BQM's linear and quadratic coefficients, :math:`q_i` and :math:`q_{i,j}` respectively 
in :math:`\sum_i^N q_ix_i + \sum_{i<j}^N q_{i,j}x_i  x_j`, which are the inputs for programming
the quantum computer.

>>> bqm = dwavebinarycsp.stitch(csp)

.. figure:: ../_images/scheduling_bqm_heatmap.png
   :name: schedulingBqmHeatmap
   :alt: image
   :align: center
   :scale: 50 %

   A heatmap of the BQM, with darker colors for higher linear (node color) and quadratic (edge color) values. You can see the values simply by using the :code:`print(bqm)` command.


Solve the Problem by Sampling
=============================

For small numbers of variables, even your computer's CPU can solve CSPs
quickly. Here you solve both classically on your CPU and on the quantum computer.

Solving Classically on a CPU
----------------------------

Before using the D-Wave system, it can sometimes be helpful to test code locally.
Here, select one of Ocean software's test samplers to solve classically on a CPU.
Ocean's :doc:`dimod </docs_dimod/sdk_index>` provides a sampler that
simply returns the BQM's value (energy) for every possible assignment of variable values.

>>> from dimod.reference.samplers import ExactSolver
>>> sampler = ExactSolver()
>>> solution = sampler.sample(bqm)

Valid solutions---assignments of variables that do not violate any constraint---should
have the lowest value of the BQM:

.. figure:: ../_images/scheduling_solution_exact.png
   :name: schedulingSolutionExact
   :alt: image
   :align: center
   :scale: 70 %

   Energy of all 16 possible configurations. You can see the values simply by using the :code:`print(solution)` command.

The code below prints all those solutions (assignments of variables) for which the BQM has
its minimum value\ [#]_\ .

>>> from math import isclose
>>> min_energy = solution.record.energy.min()
>>> for sample, energy in solution.data(['sample', 'energy']):    # doctest: +SKIP
...     if isclose(energy, min_energy, abs_tol=1.0):
...         time = 'business hours' if sample['time'] else 'evenings'
...         location = 'office' if sample['location'] else 'home'
...         length = 'short' if sample['length'] else 'long'
...         mandatory = 'mandatory' if sample['mandatory'] else 'optional'
...         print("During {} at {}, you can schedule a {} meeting that is {}".format(time, location, length, mandatory))
...
During evenings at home, you can schedule a short meeting that is optional
During evenings at home, you can schedule a short meeting that is mandatory
During business hours at office, you can schedule a short meeting that is mandatory
During business hours at office, you can schedule a long meeting that is mandatory

.. [#] Because it compares float values, this code uses the standard :code:`isclose`
   function to find values that are approximately equal. A small tolerance is needed
   to overcome rounding errors but for simplicity a value of :code:`abs_tol=1.0` is used
   because by default the :func:`~dwavebinarycsp.dwavebinarycsp.compilers.stitcher.stich` function increases the
   energy of solutions that violate one constraint by :code:`min_classical_gap=2.0`.


Solving on a D-Wave System
--------------------------

Now solve on a D-Wave system using sampler :class:`~dwave.system.samplers.DWaveSampler` 
from Ocean software's :doc:`dwave-system </docs_system/sdk_index>`. Also use
its :class:`~dwave.system.composites.EmbeddingComposite` composite to map our unstructured 
problem (variables such as :code:`time` etc.) to the sampler's graph structure (the QPU's numerically
indexed qubits) in a process known as :term:`minor-embedding`. The next code sets up
a D-Wave system as the sampler.

.. include:: min_vertex.rst
   :start-after: default-config-start-marker
   :end-before: default-config-end-marker

>>> from dwave.system import DWaveSampler, EmbeddingComposite
>>> sampler = EmbeddingComposite(DWaveSampler())      

Because the sampled solution is probabilistic, returned solutions may differ between runs. 
Typically, when submitting a problem to the system, you ask for many samples, not just one. 
This way, you see multiple “best” answers and reduce the probability of settling on a 
suboptimal answer. Below, ask for 5000 samples.

>>> sampleset = sampler.sample(bqm, num_reads=5000, label='SDK Examples - Scheduling')      

The code below prints all those solutions (assignments of variables) for which the BQM has
its minimum value and the number of times it was found.

>>> total = 0
... for sample, energy, occurrences in sampleset.data(['sample', 'energy', 'num_occurrences']):  # doctest: +SKIP
...     total = total + occurrences
...     if isclose(energy, min_energy, abs_tol=1.0):
...         time = 'business hours' if sample['time'] else 'evenings'
...         location = 'office' if sample['location'] else 'home'
...         length = 'short' if sample['length'] else 'long'
...         mandatory = 'mandatory' if sample['mandatory'] else 'optional'
...         print("{}: During {} at {}, you can schedule a {} meeting that is {}".format(occurrences, time, location, length, mandatory))
... print("Total occurrences: ", total)
...
1676: During business hours at office, you can schedule a long meeting that is mandatory
1229: During business hours at office, you can schedule a short meeting that is mandatory
1194: During evenings at home, you can schedule a short meeting that is optional
898: During evenings at home, you can schedule a short meeting that is mandatory
Total occurrences:  5000

Summary
=======

In the terminology of :ref:`oceanstack`\ , Ocean tools moved the original problem through the
following layers:

* Application: scheduling under constraints. There exist many CSPs that are computationally hard problems; for example, the
  map-coloring problem is to color all regions of a map such that any two regions sharing a border
  have different colors. The job-shop scheduling problem is to schedule multiple jobs done on several
  machines with constraints on the machines' execution of tasks.
* Method: constraint compilation.
* Sampler API: the Ocean tool builds a BQM with lowest values ("ground states") that
  correspond to assignments of variables that satisfy all constraints.
* Sampler: classical :class:`~dimod.reference.samplers.ExactSolver` and then 
  :class:`~dwave.system.samplers.DWaveSampler`.
* Compute resource: first a local CPU then a D-Wave system.
