qbsolv
======

A decomposing solver that finds a minimum value of a large quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem by splitting it into pieces. The pieces are solved using a classical solver running the tabu algorithm. qbsolv also enables configuring a D-Wave system as the solver.

For more information, see `qbsolv documentation <https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/qbsolv>`_.

It is strongly recommended that you use *dwave-hybrid* instead.
